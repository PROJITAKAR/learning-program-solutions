# Objectives

## 1. Define SPA and its benefits:

- A `Single Page Application` (SPA) loads a single HTML file and dynamically updates it using JavaScript without reloading the page.

- ### Benefits:

    - Faster navigation

    - Better user experience

    - Reduced server load
---

## 2. Define React and identify its working:

- React is a `JavaScript library` developed by Facebook to build fast, interactive user interfaces using components and a `virtual DOM`.

- It works by rendering UI elements based on `state` and `props`, updating only the changed parts of the DOM efficiently.

## 3. Differences between SPA and MPA:

| **Feature** | **SPA (Single Page App)** | **MPA (Multi Page App)** |
|-------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Pages**   | One HTML page              | Multiple HTML pages       |
| **Speed**   | Fast after initial load    | Slower due to full reloads|
| **Routing** | `Client-side` (React Router) | `Server-side`               |
| **SEO**     | Harder (without SSR)       | Easier                    |

## 4. Pros & Cons of SPA:

**Pros:**
- Fast navigation
- Better UX
- Uses `React Router` for dynamic routing

**Cons:**
- SEO challenges
- JavaScript-heavy
- Initial load time may be longer
---

## 5. Explain about React:
- React is used to build reusable, `component-based` UIs.
- Uses `JSX` syntax.
- Ideal for SPAs and modern web development.
---

## 6. Define Virtual DOM:
- A `lightweight JavaScript` representation of the real DOM.
- React compares the virtual DOM with a previous version to update only whatâ€™s needed.

---
## 7. Features of React:
- Component-based architecture
- Virtual DOM
- Unidirectional data flow
- Reusable components
- Fast rendering
- Strong community support
